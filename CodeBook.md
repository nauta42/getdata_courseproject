# CodeBook.md
This file is a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

## Analysis
From the original data set, that comprises many files, this analysis has column binded them in this order:
1.1. subject_test.txt
1.2. y_test.txt
1.3. X_test.txt
getting the test rows first, and next
2.1. subject_train.txt
2.2. y_train.txt
2.3. X_train.txt
for getting the train rows.
Afterwards the two datasets were row binded to create one dataset.

It was assigned descriptive column names for the data set:
Column 1: "SUBJECT_ID"
Column 2: "ACTIVITY_ID"
Columns 3-563: names were taken from file 'features.txt' in the original dataset.

The measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement were extracted, only subsetting the columns processed by functions mean() and std().
The column for the activity ids was replaced with the more descriptive names for the activities


3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


### step5_dataset.txt
The tidy data set created in step 5 of the instructions with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

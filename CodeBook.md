# CodeBook.md

This file is a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

## Analysis

From the original data set, that comprises many files, this analysis has column binded them in this order:

1. subject_test.txt
2. y_test.txt
3. X_test.txt

getting the test rows first, and next

1. subject_train.txt
2. y_train.txt
3. X_train.txt

for getting the train rows. Afterwards the two datasets were row binded to create one dataset.

It was assigned descriptive names for the columns 3-563, taken from file 'features.txt' in the original dataset to ease the next step in the analysis.

- Column 1: "SUBJECT_ID"
- Column 2: "ACTIVITY_ID"
- Columns 3-563: the 561 measurements described in file 'features.txt'

The measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement were extracted, subsetting the columns processed by functions mean() and std() and getting only 66 measurements.

The column for the activity ids was replaced with the more descriptive names for the activities, taken from 'activity_labels.txt'. The unnecesary ACTIVITY_ID column was removed.

The 66 measurements columns were relabeled with descriptive variable names in the format LONG_NAMES_ALL_UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES.

An independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject was created and writed to file 'step5_dataset.txt' provided with this project and described above.

### step5_dataset.txt

The tidy data set created in step 5 of the instructions with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
It is a text file with 180 rows and 68 columns.

### Variables

- "ACTIVITY" : name of the activity that makes the subject
- "SUBJECT_ID" : subject identifier

The next 66 variables are calculated AVERAGES of the variables by activity and subject.

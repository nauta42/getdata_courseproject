### README.md
This markdown text file, describes the project and explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.


### get_data.R
Script in R, downloads and unzip the data set.


### run_analysis.R
Analysis file for the course project, runs the next five steps:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


### step5_dataset.txt
The tidy data set created in step 5 of the instructions with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


### CodeBook.md
A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.
